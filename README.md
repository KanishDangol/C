# AES Implementation

This repository serves as my learning space for Git, GitHub, and C programming while implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for my Applied Cryptography class project.

## Project Overview

- AES Implementation: Developing a from-scratch implementation of the AES encryption algorithm in C.
- GUI Development: Creating a graphical user interface using the GTK library for an intuitive encryption and decryption experience.

This project helps me strengthen my understanding of cryptography while improving my coding and software development skills.
